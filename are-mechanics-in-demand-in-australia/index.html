<meta name="description" content="Wanted More space to train indemand auto mechanicsAre you thinking of pursuing a career in the automotive industry in Australia? Or are you already a mechanic looking to move to greener pastures? One of the most pressing questions you might have is whether mechanics are in demand in Australia. It&#39;s a valid concern, and we&#39;re here to provide you with all the information you need.The automotive industry in Australia has been going through a rough patch in recent years. The closure of manufacturing plants and the shift towards importing cars have affected the industry as a whole. However, while the industry may have taken a hit, the demand for mechanics has remained steady.The short answer is yes, mechanics are still in demand in Australia. In fact, the demand for qualified mechanics is higher than ever.To summarise, the automotive industry in Australia may not be what it once was, but the need for skilled mechanics is still very much present. If you&#39;re a qualified mechanic or are thinking of becoming one, you can rest assured that your skills will be in demand.Why are Mechanics in Demand in Australia?As mentioned earlier, the demand for mechanics in Australia has remained steady despite the challenges faced by the automotive industry. One of the reasons for this is the ageing of the Australian car fleet. The average age of a car in Australia is now over 10 years, which means that there is a greater need for maintenance and repairs. As a result, qualified mechanics are in high demand to keep these cars running smoothly.Another reason for the demand for mechanics is the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles. These vehicles require specialised knowledge and skills to maintain and repair, and there are currently not enough qualified mechanics to meet the demand.How to Become a Mechanic in Australia?If you&#39;re interested in becoming a mechanic in Australia, there are several pathways you can take. The most common pathway is through an apprenticeship. This involves working under a qualified mechanic while completing a Certificate III in Light Vehicle Mechanical Technology or Certificate III in Heavy Commercial Vehicle Mechanical Technology.Alternatively, you can complete a pre-apprenticeship course before applying for an apprenticeship. This will give you a head start and make you a more attractive candidate to potential employers.How Much Do Mechanics Earn in Australia?The average salary for a mechanic in Australia is around $60,000 per year. However, this can vary depending on your level of experience, qualifications, and location. Mechanics who specialise in certain areas, such as diesel engines or air conditioning, can earn higher salaries.Conclusion of Are Mechanics in Demand in AustraliaIn conclusion, while the automotive industry in Australia may have faced some challenges in recent years, the demand for qualified mechanics has remained steady. The ageing of the Australian car fleet and the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles have contributed to the demand for mechanics.
