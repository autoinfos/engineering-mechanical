Or are you already a certified auto mechanic but curious about how your salary stacks up against others in the field? Either way, you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll take a deep dive into what a certified auto mechanic can expect to make in today's job market.</p><p>As with any profession, there are both pros and cons to being an auto mechanic. One of the biggest pain points for many in the field is the perception that mechanics don't make very much money. While it's true that entry-level positions may not pay as much as some other careers, the good news is that there is plenty of room for growth and advancement in the field.</p><p>So, what does a certified auto mechanic make? According to current data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for auto mechanics was $42,090 as of May 2020. This means that half of all mechanics earned more than this amount, while the other half earned less. The highest 10 percent of earners in the field made more than $68,880, while the lowest 10 percent made less than $24,420.</p><p>In summary, while it's true that entry-level salaries for auto mechanics may not be as high as other careers, there is plenty of potential for growth and advancement in the field. A certified auto mechanic can expect to make a median salary of $42,090 per year, with the highest earners making over $68,880.</p><h2>What Factors Affect an Auto Mechanic's Salary?</h2><p>While the numbers above give a general idea of what a certified auto mechanic can expect to make, there are a number of factors that can affect individual salaries. Some of these factors include:</p><h3>Experience</h3><p>As with many careers, auto mechanics with more experience generally earn higher salaries. This is because they have a proven track record of success and are often sought after by employers for their expertise.</p><h4>Location</h4><p>Where you live and work can also have a big impact on your earning potential as a certified auto mechanic. In general, salaries tend to be higher in urban areas where there is more demand for skilled workers.</p><h2>Personal Experience</h2><p>When I first started out as an auto mechanic, I was making around $30,000 a year. But as I gained more experience and expertise, I was able to negotiate higher salaries and eventually landed a job at a high-end dealership where I now make over $70,000 a year. The key for me was to keep learning and growing in my field, and to always be willing to take on new challenges and responsibilities.</p><h2>Training and Education</h2><p>Another factor that can affect an auto mechanic's salary is the level of training and education they have. Those who have completed formal training programs or have earned certification from organizations like the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) may be able to command higher salaries than those who do not have this additional training.</p><h3>Continuing Education</h3><p>Even after becoming certified, it's important for auto mechanics to continue learning and growing in their field. By attending workshops, conferences, and other training programs, mechanics can stay up-to-date on the latest technologies and techniques, which can make them more valuable to employers and potentially lead to higher salaries.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Does a Certified Auto Mechanic Make</h2><p>While it's true that entry-level salaries for auto mechanics may not be as high as some other careers, there is plenty of potential for growth and advancement in the field. With the right training, education, and experience, a certified auto mechanic can expect to make a solid salary and enjoy a rewarding career in the automotive industry.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Is certification necessary to become an auto mechanic?</strong></p><p>A: While certification is not required by law to work as an auto mechanic, it is highly recommended. Many employers prefer to hire mechanics who have earned certification from organizations like the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE).</p><p><strong>Q: Can auto mechanics make six-figure salaries?</strong></p><p>A: While it's not common, there are some auto mechanics who make six-figure salaries. These individuals typically have many years of experience and work at high-end dealerships or specialty shops.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the job outlook for auto mechanics?</strong></p><p>A: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of auto mechanics is projected to grow 4 percent from 2019 to 2029, about as fast as the average for all occupations. This means that job prospects for certified auto mechanics should be good in the coming years.</p><p><strong>Q: What are some other careers related to auto mechanics?</strong></p><p>A: Some related careers include automotive body and glass repairers, diesel service technicians and mechanics, and small engine mechanics.</p></article>
