One of the most significant factors is location. Managers in larger cities or areas with a higher cost of living may make more money than those in smaller cities or rural areas. Experience is another factor that can affect pay. Entry-level managers will typically make less than experienced managers with several years of experience.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience</h2></p><p>As a former AutoZone manager, I can say that the job can be both challenging and rewarding.
