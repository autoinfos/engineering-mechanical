In this article, we will take a closer look at how much ultrasound technicians make in Alberta, and what factors can affect their salary.</p><p>Ultrasound technicians, also known as diagnostic medical sonographers, are responsible for performing ultrasound scans on patients to help diagnose medical conditions.

However, this can vary depending on a number of factors, such as experience, education, location, and the type of employer you work for.
