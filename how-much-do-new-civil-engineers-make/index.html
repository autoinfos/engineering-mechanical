LSU Online</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you considering a career in civil engineering but wondering just how much you can earn? If so, you're not alone. Salary is always an important consideration when choosing a career path. So, let's take a closer look at how much new civil engineers typically make.</p><p>Starting out in any profession can be tough, and civil engineering is no exception. Many new civil engineers struggle to find work or end up taking lower-paying jobs just to gain experience. This can be a frustrating and discouraging experience for those who have invested time and money into their education and training.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the good news is that new civil engineers can still earn a decent salary, especially as they gain more experience and expertise.</p><p>So, how much can you expect to make as a new civil engineer? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for civil engineers in the United States is $87,060. However, this can vary depending on factors such as location, industry, and level of experience.</p><h2>Personal Experience: Starting Out as a Civil Engineer</h2><p>When I first graduated from college with my civil engineering degree, I struggled to find work in my field. I ended up taking a job as a project manager for a construction company, which paid significantly less than what I had hoped for. However, I was able to gain valuable experience and eventually landed a job as a civil engineer with a consulting firm.</p><p>As a new civil engineer, I started out making around $60,000 per year. However, as I gained more experience and took on more responsibility, my salary increased to around $80,000 per year.</p><h2>Factors that Affect Salary</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, there are several factors that can affect how much a new civil engineer makes. Location is one of the biggest factors, as salaries can vary significantly from state to state and even within different cities within the same state. For example, civil engineers in California typically earn higher salaries than those in Alabama.</p><p>The industry you work in can also affect your salary. Civil engineers who work in the private sector, such as consulting firms or construction companies, may earn more than those who work in the public sector, such as government agencies.</p><p>Finally, your level of experience and expertise can also impact your salary. As you gain more experience and take on more responsibilities, you may be eligible for promotions or higher-paying job opportunities.</p><h3>Earning Potential for Experienced Civil Engineers</h3><p>If you're willing to put in the time and effort to gain experience and expertise in civil engineering, you can potentially earn a six-figure salary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the top 10% of civil engineers earn more than $144,560 per year.</p><h4>Tips for Maximizing Your Salary as a Civil Engineer</h4><p>If you're looking to maximize your earning potential as a civil engineer, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Gain as much experience as possible, even if it means taking on lower-paying jobs at first</li><li>Consider pursuing additional certifications or specializations to make yourself more marketable</li><li>Look for job opportunities in high-paying industries or locations</li><li>Build a strong professional network to learn about potential job opportunities and negotiate higher salaries</li></ul><h2>Conclusion of How Much Do New Civil Engineers Make</h2><p>While starting out as a new civil engineer can be challenging, there is still potential to earn a decent salary with hard work and dedication.
