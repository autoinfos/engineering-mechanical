They may also perform routine maintenance tasks, like oil changes and tire rotations.</p><h3>Q: Is it possible to become a mechanic without any formal qualifications?</h3><p>A: While it is technically possible to become a mechanic without formal qualifications, it can be difficult to find work in this field without them. Additionally, you may struggle to perform your duties effectively without proper training.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you're interested in becoming a mechanic in South Africa, it's important to have the right qualifications.
