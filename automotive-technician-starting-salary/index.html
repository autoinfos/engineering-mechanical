However, this was in a smaller town with a lower cost of living. If you're in a larger city, you may be able to earn more.

Additionally, those who work for dealerships or specialty repair shops may be able to earn more than those who work for general automotive repair shops.</p><h4>How Can You Negotiate a Higher Starting Salary as an Automotive Technician?</h4><p>One way to negotiate a higher starting salary as an automotive technician is to highlight any relevant experience or certifications you may have. Additionally, doing research on the average salaries for technicians in your area and bringing this information to your employer may help you negotiate a higher salary. However, it's important to remember that while negotiating is important, you should also be realistic and understand that the starting salary may be firm.</p><h2>What Can You Expect in Terms of Salary Growth as an Automotive Technician?</h2><p>As you gain experience and further your education, you can expect to see your salary increase. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, those in the top 10 percent of earners in this field make over $70,000 per year. Additionally, those who move into management positions or open their own repair shops can earn even more.</p><h2>Conclusion of Automotive Technician Starting Salary</h2><p>While the starting salary for automotive technicians may not be as high as some other careers, it's important to remember that this is just a starting point. With experience, education, and hard work, you can increase your earning potential and move up the ladder in the automotive industry. Don't let the starting salary discourage you from pursuing a career as an automotive technician.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: What is the average starting salary for automotive technicians?</strong></p><p>A: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $44,050 as of May 2020.
