Dental assistants in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne may earn more than those in smaller towns and rural areas.</p><p><h2>How to Negotiate Your Dental Assistant Salary</h2></p><p>Negotiating your dental assistant salary can be tricky, but it's important to advocate for yourself and ensure that you are being fairly compensated for the work you do. Here are some tips for negotiating your salary:</p><p><h3>Research</h3></p><p>Before you start negotiating your salary, do some research to find out what other dental assistants in your area are earning.
