Some of these factors include location, level of experience, and certifications. Additionally, the type of HVAC work can also impact earnings. For example, an HVAC technician who specializes in commercial systems may earn more than one who works primarily on residential systems.</p><p>On average, HVAC technicians in the United States make around $25 per hour. However, this can range from $15 to $40 per hour depending on the factors mentioned above. It's important to note that some HVAC technicians also earn additional income through commissions or bonuses for meeting certain performance goals.</p><p>In summary, HVAC technicians can earn a decent hourly wage, but their earnings can vary depending on several factors. Let's take a closer look at some of these factors:</p><h2>The Impact of Location on HVAC Technician Wages</h2><p>Location is one of the most significant factors that can affect how much an HVAC technician makes per hour.

Additionally, areas that experience extreme temperatures may require more HVAC technicians, which can lead to higher wages due to increased demand.</p><p>For example, HVAC technicians working in New York City can expect to earn an average of $29 per hour. On the other hand, those working in rural areas may earn closer to $20 per hour.</p><h2>The Impact of Certifications on HVAC Technician Wages</h2><p>Another factor that can impact HVAC technician wages is certifications. Technicians who hold certifications from organizations such as the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may be able to earn more due to their specialized knowledge and skills.</p><p>Certifications can also lead to more job opportunities, as some employers may require certain certifications for specific positions. This can result in higher wages for those who hold these certifications.</p><h3>The Importance of Experience in HVAC Technician Wages</h3><p>Experience is another crucial factor in determining an HVAC technician's earnings. Technicians with more experience typically earn higher wages due to their knowledge and expertise. Additionally, experienced technicians may be able to take on more complex and higher-paying jobs.</p><p>Entry-level HVAC technicians can expect to earn around $15 to $18 per hour. However, those with several years of experience can earn closer to $30 per hour.</p><h4>Tips for Increasing Your HVAC Technician Wage</h4><p>If you're looking to increase your earnings as an HVAC technician, there are several steps you can take. These include:</p><ul><li>Obtaining certifications to demonstrate your expertise</li><li>Seeking out higher-paying job opportunities, such as those in commercial HVAC</li><li>Continuing your education to stay up-to-date with the latest HVAC technology</li><li>Networking with other HVAC professionals to learn about job opportunities and industry trends</li></ul><h2>Questions and Answers about How Much Does HVAC Technicians Make an Hour</h2><p><strong>Q: Is it possible to earn more than $40 per hour as an HVAC technician?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> While $40 per hour is on the high end, some HVAC technicians may be able to earn more than this.
