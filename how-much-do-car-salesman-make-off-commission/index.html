<meta name="description" content="How Much Do Car Salesmen Make? Salary, Commission, Tax CalculatorBuying a car can be a stressful experience. You have to decide what type of car you want, what features you need, and how much you can afford. And then there&#39;s negotiating the price with the car salesman. But have you ever wondered how much those car salesmen are making off of your purchase?It&#39;s no secret that car salesmen work on commission. That means the more cars they sell, the more money they make. But what does that mean for you as the buyer?On average, car salesmen make a commission of 25% of the profit that the dealership makes on the sale of a car. So if the dealership makes a profit of $1,000 on the sale of a car, the salesman would make a commission of $250. However, this number can vary greatly depending on the dealership and the car salesman&#39;s level of experience.In addition to their commission, car salesmen may also receive bonuses for selling a certain number of cars, or for selling cars with certain features or options. This can add up to a significant amount of money for the salesman, but it can also lead to high-pressure sales tactics and pushy behavior.My Experience with Car Salesmen CommissionWhen I was in the market for a new car, I did my research ahead of time and knew exactly what I wanted. I was able to negotiate a fair price with the salesman, but I could tell that he was eager to make the sale and earn his commission. He tried to push me into buying add-ons and features that I didn&#39;t need or want, but I stood my ground and only purchased what I had originally planned.The Pros and Cons of Commission-Based SalesThe commission-based sales model can be beneficial for both the salesman and the dealership. The salesman has the opportunity to earn a significant amount of money if they are successful in selling cars, and the dealership benefits from increased sales and profits. However, this can also lead to high-pressure sales tactics and pushy behavior, which can be a turn-off for customers.The Impact of Experience on CommissionThe amount of commission that a car salesman earns can vary greatly depending on their level of experience. New salesmen may only earn a commission of 15% or less, while experienced salesmen can earn upwards of 30% or more. This means that the more experienced a salesman is, the more money they have the potential to earn.How to Negotiate with a Commission-Based SalesmanIf you&#39;re in the market for a new car, it&#39;s important to be prepared for the negotiations with the car salesman. Do your research ahead of time and know what you want and what you can afford. Stand your ground and don&#39;t let the salesman push you into buying something that you don&#39;t need or want.Conclusion of How Much Do Car Salesmen Make Off CommissionWhen it comes to buying a car, it&#39;s important to be aware of the commission-based sales model that most dealerships use. While this can lead to pushy behavior from the salesman, it can also be a beneficial arrangement for both the salesman and the dealership. By doing your research ahead of time and being prepared for negotiations, you can ensure that you get the best deal possible on your new car.Question and AnswerQ: Can you negotiate the commission rate with a car salesman?A: No, the commission rate is set by the dealership and is non-negotiable.Q: Is it better to buy a car from a dealership or a private seller?A: It depends on your personal preferences and needs. Buying from a dealership can offer more options and warranties, but buying from a private seller may be less expensive.Q: Do car salesmen only make commission on new cars, or do they also earn commission on used cars?A: Car salesmen earn commission on both new and used cars.Q: How do car salesmen determine the price of a car?A: The price of a car is determined by the dealership and is based on factors such as the make and model of the car, the features and options included, and the current market demand..">
