While it's true that salary for electrical technician can vary based on a number of factors, there are some general figures that can give you an idea of what to expect.</p><p>One of the biggest pain points related to salary for electrical technician is the fact that many people assume this job doesn't pay well.

When I started out, I was earning around $40,000 per year, but as I gained more experience and took on more advanced roles, my salary increased significantly.

During that time, I've been able to earn a good salary and provide for my family comfortably. However, I've also had to work hard and continually improve my skills in order to stay competitive in the field.</p><p>One thing that has helped me increase my earning potential as an electrical technician is continuing education. By taking courses and earning certifications in advanced electrical work, I've been able to take on more challenging projects and earn a higher salary as a result.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: Is it possible to earn a good salary as an electrical technician right out of school?</p><p>A: Yes, it is possible to earn a decent salary as an electrical technician right out of school, especially if you have the right certifications and skills.</p><p>Q: What is the average hourly rate for electrical technicians?</p><p>A: According to the BLS, the median hourly wage for electrical technicians was $29.89 as of May 2020.</p><p>Q: What are some of the highest-paying industries for electrical technicians?</p><p>A: Some of the highest-paying industries for electrical technicians include aerospace product and parts manufacturing, natural gas distribution, and electric power generation.</p><p>Q: What is the job outlook for electrical technicians?</p><p>A: According to the BLS, employment of electrical technicians is projected to grow 8 percent from 2019 to 2029, faster than the average for all occupations.</p><h2>Conclusion of Salary for Electrical Technician</h2><p>Overall, salary for electrical technician can be quite good, especially for those who are willing to put in the work and gain experience.
