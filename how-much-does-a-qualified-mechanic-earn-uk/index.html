These factors include the mechanic's level of experience, the location of the garage or dealership they work for, and the type of vehicles they specialize in repairing.</p><p>In general, however, the average salary for a qualified mechanic in the UK is around £28,000 to £35,000 per year. This can vary depending on the factors mentioned above, as well as the specific qualifications and certifications that the mechanic holds.</p><p>In summary, becoming a mechanic can be a satisfying career choice, but it's important to understand the potential earnings and challenges that come with it.

This can include completing an apprenticeship or vocational training program, as well as obtaining certifications from industry organizations like the Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI).</p><p><h4>How to Improve Your Earnings as a Mechanic</h4></p><p>One way to increase your earnings as a mechanic is to specialize in a particular area of the industry. For example, you may choose to focus on repairing hybrid or electric vehicles, which can require specialized knowledge and skills.
