(With images) Pharmacy</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Do you have a passion for helping people and an interest in medicine? Becoming a pharmacy technician may be the perfect career for you. Pharmacy technicians work alongside pharmacists to prepare and dispense medications to patients. However, before you can start your career as a pharmacy technician, you need to become certified.</p><p>The process of becoming a certified pharmacy technician can seem overwhelming at first. From understanding the requirements to finding the right program, it's easy to feel lost in the process. Additionally, many people are hesitant to pursue certification because they don't know where to start or feel intimidated by the coursework.</p><p>The first step in becoming a certified pharmacy technician is to complete a training program. This program must be approved by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) or the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). Once you have completed the program, you will need to take and pass the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam (PTCE). This exam is administered by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB).</p><p>In summary, to become a certified pharmacy technician, you need to:</p><ul><li>Complete an ACPE or ASHP-approved training program</li><li>Pass the PTCE</li></ul><h2>Choosing the Right Program</h2><p>When looking for a training program, it's important to choose one that is accredited by the ACPE or ASHP. This ensures that the program meets the standards set by recognized accrediting bodies. Additionally, you should consider the program's format, cost, and location.</p><p>Personally, I chose an online program because it offered flexibility with my work schedule. However, some people prefer in-person programs to have more hands-on experience. It's essential to research and compare programs to find the one that best fits your needs.</p><h2>Preparation for the PTCE</h2><p>Preparing for the PTCE can be nerve-wracking, but there are many resources available to help you. Study materials, practice exams, and review courses are all excellent options. Additionally, working in a pharmacy as an intern or extern can provide valuable hands-on experience.</p><p>Personally, I used a combination of study materials and an online review course. I also found it helpful to take practice exams to gauge my progress and identify areas where I needed to improve.</p><h3>Continuing Education Requirements</h3><p>Once you become certified, you will need to complete continuing education (CE) requirements to maintain your certification. This ensures that you stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. The PTCB requires 20 hours of CE every two years.</p><p>There are many ways to fulfill CE requirements. Some options include attending conferences, completing online courses, or participating in pharmacy-related activities. It's important to keep track of your CE credits and ensure that you complete them before your certification expires.</p><h4>Employment Opportunities</h4><p>Becoming a certified pharmacy technician opens up many job opportunities. Certified pharmacy technicians can work in various settings, including retail pharmacies, hospitals, and long-term care facilities. Additionally, many certified pharmacy technicians go on to pursue further education and become pharmacists.</p><p>Personally, I work in a retail pharmacy and enjoy the fast-paced environment and the opportunity to interact with patients. However, there are many other options available, and it's important to find the setting that best fits your interests and skills.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: What are the eligibility requirements for the PTCE?</strong></p><p>A: To be eligible for the PTCE, you must have a high school diploma or equivalent and have completed an ACPE or ASHP-approved training program.</p><p><strong>Q: How much does it cost to become certified?</strong></p><p>A: The cost of becoming certified varies depending on the program and exam. However, you can expect to pay between $500 and $1,500 for training and exam fees.</p><p><strong>Q: How long does it take to become certified?</strong></p><p>A: The length of time it takes to become certified depends on the program you choose. Some programs can be completed in as little as six months, while others may take up to two years.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I work as a pharmacy technician without certification?</strong></p><p>A: Regulations vary by state, but most require pharmacy technicians to be certified. Additionally, many employers prefer to hire certified pharmacy technicians because they have the necessary knowledge and skills.</p><h2>Conclusion of How to Get Certified to Be a Pharmacy Technician</h2><p>Becoming a certified pharmacy technician is a rewarding and fulfilling career path for those interested in medicine and helping others. While the process of becoming certified can seem daunting, with the right resources and preparation, it's achievable. By completing an ACPE or ASHP-approved training program and passing the PTCE, you'll be on your way to a career as a certified pharmacy technician.</p></article>
