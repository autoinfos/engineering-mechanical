<meta name="description" content="Environmental Engineering Workforce SolutionsAre you wondering how much money engineers make per year? It&#39;s a common question, especially for those considering a career in engineering or those already in the field who want to know if they&#39;re being paid fairly. In this blog post, we&#39;ll explore the average salaries of engineers, their pain points, and what factors affect their income.Engineering can be a lucrative career, but it also involves a lot of hard work and dedication. Engineers often have to work long hours, meet tight deadlines, and constantly update their skills to stay competitive. Despite these challenges, many engineers find the work rewarding and the pay worth the effort.The salary of an engineer can vary widely depending on their industry, experience, and location. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for all engineers in May 2020 was $81,440. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $51,250, while the highest 10 percent earned more than $138,880.In general, engineers who work in industries such as oil and gas extraction, computer and electronic product manufacturing, and aerospace product and parts manufacturing tend to have higher salaries. Engineers who have advanced degrees or certifications also often earn more than those who only have a bachelor&#39;s degree.My Experience as an EngineerAs an electrical engineer with 10 years of experience, I can say that the industry has been rewarding both financially and intellectually.
