One of the most important factors to consider is the average salary for this profession. As a structural engineer, you design and oversee the construction of buildings, bridges, and other structures. But what can you expect to earn in this role? Let's take a closer look.</p><p>One of the biggest pain points for those considering a career in structural engineering is the potential for a lower salary compared to other engineering professions.
