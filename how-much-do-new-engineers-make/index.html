Or are you considering switching to engineering as a career but unsure of the pay? This article will answer your question of "how much do new engineers make?" in a way that's easy to understand.</p><p>We understand that starting a new career can be stressful, especially when it comes to finances. The uncertainty of not knowing how much you'll make can be overwhelming. It's important to know how much you can expect to earn as a new engineer to plan your finances and set realistic expectations.</p><p>According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), the average starting salary for engineering graduates is $69,961. However, this can vary depending on the type of engineering degree you have, your location, and the industry you work in.</p><p>In summary, the starting salary for new engineers is around $70,000. However, this can vary depending on several factors such as location, industry, and type of engineering degree. </p><h2>What Determines the Starting Salary of a New Engineer?</h2><p>Now that we've established the average starting salary for new engineers, let's dive deeper into what factors determine this figure. </p><p>Location plays a significant role in determining the starting salary of a new engineer. For instance, an engineer in San Francisco will earn more than an engineer in a small town because the cost of living is higher in a big city.</p><p>The industry you work in also determines your starting salary. For example, engineers in the tech industry tend to earn more than those in the construction industry.</p><p>The type of engineering degree you have also plays a role in determining your starting salary. Some engineering fields, such as petroleum or computer engineering, tend to pay more than others.</p><h2>Real-Life Experience of a New Engineer's Salary</h2><p>As a recent engineering graduate, I can attest to the fact that starting salaries vary a lot. I was lucky to secure a job at a tech company in San Francisco and was offered a starting salary of $80,000. However, my friend who graduated with the same degree but worked in a small town in Texas was offered a starting salary of $55,000.</p><p>It's essential to research the average starting salary for your engineering field, location, and industry to get a rough idea of what to expect.</p><h2>How Can New Engineers Negotiate Their Starting Salary?</h2><p>Negotiating your starting salary as a new engineer can be intimidating, but it's essential to get paid what you're worth. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Research the Average Salary for Your Field</h3><p>Research is key when it comes to negotiating your starting salary. Use websites such as Glassdoor, Payscale, or NACE to get an idea of what other engineers in your field are making.</p><h4>Highlight Your Accomplishments</h4><p>During the interview, make sure to highlight any accomplishments you achieved during your studies or internships. This shows the employer that you have valuable skills and experience that justify a higher salary.</p><h2>Conclusion of How Much Do New Engineers Make</h2><p>Starting salaries for new engineers vary depending on several factors such as location, industry, and type of engineering degree.
