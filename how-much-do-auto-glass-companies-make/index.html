The company I worked for had several branches across the city and employed over 50 people. They had a steady stream of customers, and their prices were competitive.</p><p>One of the reasons why auto glass businesses can be profitable is because auto glass is a necessity.

First, you need to conduct market research to determine if there is demand for auto glass services in your area. You also need to research your competition and identify ways to differentiate your business from theirs.</p><p>Next, you need to create a business plan that outlines your goals, strategies, and financial projections. You also need to obtain the necessary permits and licenses to operate your business legally.</p><p>Once you have completed these steps, you can start marketing your business and attracting customers.
