However, an automotive engineer working in the aerospace and defense industry can earn around $95,000 per year.</p><h4>How Does Education Affect an Automotive Engineer's Salary?</h4><p>Education is a critical factor that affects an automotive engineer's salary. Generally, an automotive engineer with a master's degree or Ph.D. can earn a higher salary than an automotive engineer with a bachelor's degree. </p><p>For example, an entry-level automotive engineer with a bachelor's degree can earn around $50,000 per year. However, an entry-level automotive engineer with a master's degree can earn around $60,000 per year. Similarly, a senior automotive engineer with a Ph.D. can earn around $135,000 per year.</p><h2>What is the Job Outlook for Automotive Engineers?</h2><p>The job outlook for automotive engineers is positive.
