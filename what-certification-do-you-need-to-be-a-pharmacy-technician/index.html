<meta name="description" content="How To A Certified Surgical Technician Pharmacy Technician WorkDo you have an interest in the healthcare industry but don&#39;t want to spend years in medical school? Becoming a pharmacy technician may be the perfect career path for you. Pharmacy technicians work under the supervision of licensed pharmacists to help dispense medication, provide customer service, and perform administrative tasks. However, before you can start your career as a pharmacy technician, you need to know what certification you need to obtain.Aspiring pharmacy technicians often wonder what certification they need to obtain before they can legally work in a pharmacy. It can be confusing to navigate the different certification options and requirements, but it is crucial to ensure you meet the necessary qualifications. Without the proper certification, you will not be able to work as a pharmacy technician.The certification you need to become a pharmacy technician varies by state. Some states require pharmacy technicians to be certified by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB), and others require certification by the National Healthcareer Association (NHA).

For example, some states may require pharmacy technicians to register with the state board of pharmacy or complete additional training programs. It is crucial to research the requirements for your state before pursuing certification.</p><p><h3>PTCB Certification</h3></p><p>The PTCB certification exam consists of 90 multiple-choice questions and is administered at Pearson VUE test centers across the United States. The exam covers four main areas: medications, federal requirements, patient safety, and order entry and processing.</p><p><h4>How to Prepare for the PTCE Exam</h4></p><p>Preparing for the PTCE exam is essential to ensure you pass on your first attempt. There are many resources available to help you study, including online courses, study guides, and practice exams. It is also recommended to gain hands-on experience working in a pharmacy, as this will help you understand the material better.</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>Obtaining the proper certification is essential to becoming a successful pharmacy technician. While the certification requirements may vary by state, the PTCB certification is widely recognized by employers across the United States.
