It's important to understand the earning potential of this career path so you can make an informed decision about whether it's the right choice for you.</p><p>The answer to how much car salesmen make starting out is not straightforward. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for a retail salesperson in the United States is $25,440. However, salaries can vary widely depending on the type of dealership you work for, your location, and your individual sales performance.</p><p>In general, car salesmen starting out can expect to make around $30,000 to $40,000 per year. However, top performers can earn significantly more, with some earning six-figure salaries.

However, there are a number of other factors that can impact your salary:</p><h3>Type of Dealership</h3><p>The type of dealership you work for can have a big impact on your earnings potential. Luxury car dealerships tend to offer higher salaries and commissions than lower-end dealerships.</p><h4>Location</h4><p>Your location can also impact your earnings as a car salesman. Dealerships in larger cities or more affluent areas may offer higher salaries and commissions than those in rural areas or less affluent regions.</p><h2>How to Maximize Your Earnings as a Car Salesman</h2><p>If you're looking to maximize your earnings as a car salesman, there are a number of things you can do:</p><h3>Focus on Building Relationships with Customers</h3><p>Building relationships with customers is key to success in car sales.
