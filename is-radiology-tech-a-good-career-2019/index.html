With the ever-changing job market and advancements in technology, it&#39;s important to know if a career in radiology tech is a good choice for you in 2019 and beyond.One of the biggest concerns for those considering a career in radiology tech is the job outlook. The good news is that the demand for radiology technologists is expected to grow by 9% from 2018 to 2028, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This growth is due to the aging population and the need for more medical professionals in the healthcare industry.Another factor to consider is salary. The median annual wage for radiologic technologists was $60,510 in May 2018. The top 10 percent earned more than $82,590, and the lowest 10 percent earned less than $40,250. The salary can vary depending on experience, location, and type of employer.In summary, a career in radiology tech can be a rewarding and financially stable choice in 2019. With a growing demand for medical professionals and a competitive salary, it&#39;s definitely worth considering.What is Radiology Tech?As a radiologic technologist, you will be responsible for operating imaging equipment to produce images of the body for diagnostic purposes. This includes X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and mammography. You will work closely with patients to position them correctly for the imaging procedure and ensure that the images produced are of high quality.Personally, I have been working as a radiologic technologist for the past 5 years and have found it to be a very rewarding career. I enjoy working with patients and being a part of their healthcare journey. The job can be physically demanding at times, but the satisfaction of helping others makes it all worth it.Education and CertificationTo become a radiologic technologist, you will need to complete a 2-year associate&#39;s degree program in radiologic technology or a 4-year bachelor&#39;s degree program. You will also need to become certified or licensed in the state in which you work. The requirements for certification vary by state, but most require passing an exam from the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists.Career AdvancementAs a radiologic technologist, there are opportunities for career advancement. You can specialize in a specific area of radiology, such as mammography or CT scans. You can also become a supervisor or manager in a radiology department. With additional education and training, you can become a radiologist assistant, which involves working alongside a radiologist to diagnose and treat patients.How to Succeed in Radiology TechTo succeed in a career in radiology tech, it&#39;s important to have strong communication and interpersonal skills.
