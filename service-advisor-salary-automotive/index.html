Some companies may offer more generous compensation packages than others, and it's important to do your research before accepting a job offer.</p><h3>Education and Certification for Service Advisor Salary in Automotive</h3><p>While formal education is not always required for service advisor roles, having a degree or certification in a related field can certainly help to increase your earning potential.
