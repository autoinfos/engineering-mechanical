If so, you may be wondering about the typical salary for this position. While the answer may vary depending on several factors, including location, experience, and the specific company you work for, there are some general insights that may be helpful in understanding car sales manager salary in India.</p><p>One of the main pain points related to car sales manager salary in India is the wide range of salaries offered across the industry.
