The hours can be long and the work can be physically demanding. Additionally, many entry level positions require you to work outdoors in all types of weather conditions. However, if you're willing to put in the hard work, the railroad industry can provide you with a stable and rewarding career.</p><p>Entry level railroad jobs are positions that require little to no experience in the industry. These jobs are designed to provide workers with on-the-job training and the skills necessary to advance to higher level positions within the railroad industry. Some common entry level jobs in the railroad industry include conductor trainees, locomotive engineers, carmen, and track maintenance workers.</p><p>To land an entry level position in the railroad industry, you'll need to meet certain qualifications. Most jobs require a high school diploma or equivalent, a valid driver's license, and the ability to pass a drug and alcohol screening. Additionally, some jobs may require you to have a commercial driver's license or a specific certification, such as a conductor's certification.</p><h2>Conductor Trainee</h2><p>One of the most common entry level jobs in the railroad industry is the conductor trainee position.

It was a challenging transition, but I enjoyed the increased responsibility and the opportunity to operate the locomotive. As a locomotive engineer, I was responsible for ensuring that the train was moving at the correct speed and that it was following the correct route.</p><h3>Carmen</h3><p>If you're interested in working in the maintenance side of the railroad industry, you may want to consider a career as a carmen. As a carmen, your job will be to inspect, repair, and maintain railroad cars. This may include replacing broken parts, cleaning and lubricating equipment, and performing routine maintenance tasks.</p><p>While I never worked as a carmen myself, I had many friends and colleagues who enjoyed this position. It requires a great deal of attention to detail and a willingness to work in all types of weather conditions. However, it can be a rewarding career for those who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems.</p><h4>Track Maintenance Worker</h4><p>Another entry level job in the railroad industry is the track maintenance worker position. As a track maintenance worker, your job will be to inspect, repair, and maintain the railroad tracks. This may include replacing damaged rails, repairing switches, and clearing debris from the tracks.</p><p>While I never worked as a track maintenance worker, I knew many colleagues who enjoyed this position.
