Or are you already a service advisor and wondering if you&#39;re being paid fairly? Knowing how much service advisors make in Canada can be helpful in making informed decisions about your career and finances.Service advisors are responsible for coordinating vehicle repairs and maintenance for customers at dealerships and repair shops. They are often the first point of contact for customers and are responsible for providing estimates, scheduling appointments, and communicating with technicians. However, being a service advisor can be a challenging job, with long hours and demanding customers.According to data from PayScale, the average salary for a service advisor in Canada is around $45,000 per year. However, salaries can range from $29,000 to $65,000 depending on factors such as location, experience, and employer.

Alternatively, service advisors can become certified as automotive service technicians, which can lead to higher salaries and more job opportunities.Factors Affecting SalaryAs mentioned earlier, several factors can affect a service advisor&#39;s salary. Location is a significant factor, as salaries tend to be higher in larger cities.
