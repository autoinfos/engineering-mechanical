This job requires a lot of creativity and innovation, as well as a deep understanding of how different parts of a car work together. The average salary for a performance mechanic is around $60,000 per year.</p><p>Personally, I have always been interested in performance mechanics, and I've spent a lot of time modifying my own cars.
