However, the median salary for an auto mechanic in Florida is around $42,000 per year.While this may seem like a modest salary, it&#39;s important to note that this is just the median. Many experienced mechanics can make well over $60,000 per year, and those who specialize in certain areas like diesel engines or high-performance vehicles can command even higher salaries.In summary, the average salary for an auto mechanic in Florida can vary widely depending on various factors, but experienced mechanics who specialize in certain areas can earn a comfortable living.The Importance of CertificationOne of the most important factors that can impact your earning potential as an auto mechanic in Florida is certification.
